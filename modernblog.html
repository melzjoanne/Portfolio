          <h2>1. Git: Version Control System <img src="git.png" class="blog-img"></h2>
          <p>Git is an indispensable tool for tracking changes in your codebase and collaborating with other developers.
            It allows you to manage different versions of your project, revert changes, and work on multiple features
            simultaneously without conflicts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-card">
          <h2>2. Visual Studio Code: Versatile Code Editor <img src="vs.png" class="blog-img"></h2>
          <p>VS Code has become the go-to editor for many developers due to its speed, extensibility, and built-in
            features like IntelliSense, debugging support, and Git integration. Its vast marketplace of extensions
            allows you to customize it for any programming language or framework.</p>

        <div class="tool-card">
          <h2>3. Docker: Containerization Platform <img src="img/dock.jpeg" class="blog-img"></h2>
          <p>Docker simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and running applications by using containerization.
            It
            ensures that your application works seamlessly across different environments, from development to
            production, by packaging it with all its dependencies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-card">
          <h2>4. Postman: API Development and Testing Tool<img src="post.png" class="blog-img"></h2>
          <p>Postman is crucial for developing and testing APIs. It allows you to send HTTP requests, organize APIs into
            collections, automate tests, and collaborate with team members. Its intuitive interface makes it easy to
            debug and document your APIs effectively.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-card">
          <h2>5. Jenkins: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Tool<img src="jens.png" class="blog-img">
          </h2>
          <p>Jenkins automates the software development process through continuous integration and continuous delivery.
            It helps in building, testing, and deploying your code, ensuring that changes are integrated smoothly and
            reducing the time between writing code and releasing it to production.</p>
