              <section>
            <p class="text">I am currently a second year undergraduate pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.<br>
              I have a passion for technology and have been particularly focused on areas like software development and web technologies.
             
            While I may not have extensive professional experience yet, I am willing to learn and grow.<br>
             I actively seek opportunities to enhance my skills through projects, workshops, and internships.<br> My coursework has equipped me with a solid foundation in web and software development,<br> 
             and I’m eager to apply this knowledge in real-world settings.
            Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, music, tiktoks and trying out new recipes 
            which inspire my creativity and drive. I believe that combining my studies with these interests helps me bring a unique perspective to my work.
            As I continue my journey, I’m looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring opportunities that align with my passion for the IT .
