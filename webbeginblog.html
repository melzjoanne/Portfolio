        <h2> HTML, HTML 5 and CSS: The Mains</h2>
        <p>These three languages form the backbone of web development. HTML structures your content,
          CSS makes it look good. Start here, and you'll have a solid foundation for
          everything else.
        <p> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language.
          HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
          Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within
          the tag which defines the structure of web pages.
          This language is used to annotate (at the note for the computer)
          text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly.</p>
        <p> HTML5, the latest evolution of HTML, offers significant advancements over its predecessor. While HTML
          provides the fundamental structure for web pages,
          HTML5 introduces enhanced features like semantic elements for better organization, native support for audio
          and video, advanced storage options, and offline capabilities.
          It also empowers developers to create dynamic, interactive graphics with Canvas and SVG. These improvements
          make HTML5 a more powerful and versatile tool for building modern web applications,
          delivering richer user experiences, and optimizing performance.</p>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to control the layout of web pages. CSS is used to separate
          the presentation part of a document from the structure part.
          It is used to control the layout of web pages.</p>

        <h2>HTML5 Semantic Elements which structures your content</h2>
        <p> HTML5 introduced a range of semantic elements that help you structure your content in a more meaningful way.
          These elements provide better context for both search engines and screen readers.
          Semantic elements are HTML5 elements that convey meaning about the content they contain.
          Unlike non-semantic elements like &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;,
          semantic elements provide context to both the browser and search engines.
          This makes your HTML code more readable, maintainable, and accessible.

          For instance, the &lt;header&gt, &lt;nav&gt;,&lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;,&lt;aside&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;
          elements can be used to define specific sections of your page.

          By using semantic elements, you improve the accessibility and SEO of your website.

        <h2> Responsive Design which adapts to Different Screen sizes</h2>
        <p>Responsive design is a technique to ensure yout website looks great on any device,
          from desktop computers to smartphones. The core idea is to use flexible grids and media queries to adjust
          the layout and content based on the screen sizes

      <div class="tool-card">
        <h2>Flexbox Directions which layouts your elements</h2>
        <p>Flexbox is a CSS layout model that allows you to arrange items flexibly within a container.
          One of the key properties of Flexbox is the flex- direction property, which determine the main - axis
          direction
          of the flex container.

      <div class="tool-card">
        <h2>Specificity Rules which prioritizes styles</h2>
        <p>Specificity is a mechanism that determines which CSS rule applies when multiple rules target the same
          element. Rules with higher specificity will override rules with lower specificity. Specificity is calculated
          based on four factors. they are,
          Inline styles
          IDs
          Classes
          Elements and pseudo-elements nderstanding specificity is crucial for resolving style conflicts and ensuring
          that your CSS rules are applied as intended.
