                1. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The Foundation
                These three languages form the backbone of web development. HTML structures your content, CSS makes it look good, and JavaScript adds interactivity. Start here, and you'll have a solid foundation for everything else.
                2. Responsive Design
                With people accessing websites on various devices, it's crucial to learn how to make your sites look good on any screen size. Tools like CSS Flexbox and Grid can help you create flexible layouts.
                3. Version Control with Git
                Learn to use Git early. It's like a save point for your code and is essential when you start working on larger projects or with teams.
                4. Basic Command Line Skills
                While not strictly web development, being comfortable with the command line will make many tasks easier as you progress.
                5. Choose a Beginner-Friendly Framework
                Once you're comfortable with the basics, consider learning a framework like React or Vue. They can help you build more complex applications more efficiently.
                6. Web Accessibility
                Learning to make your websites accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, is not just good practiceâ€”it's essential in today's web.
                7. Continuous Learning
                Web development is always evolving. Embrace a mindset of continuous learning. Follow blogs, join coding communities, and never stop practicing!
                Remember, everyone starts somewhere. Take your time, practice regularly, and don't be afraid to ask for help. Happy coding!
